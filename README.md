# AI-Powered Crypto Trading Strategy Optimization & Signal Intelligence System

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Crypto Trading Strategy Optimization & Signal Intelligence System** is a fully integrated end-to-end solution for crypto trading. It combines advanced machine learning, deep learning, and real-time AI-driven insights for dynamic cryptocurrency trading strategy development. This system incorporates market data collection, feature engineering, model training, backtesting, real-time sentiment analysis, signal delivery, and a professional dashboard interface for monitoring.

The project is designed to optimize trading strategies, generate Buy/Sell/Hold signals, and automate the entire crypto trading decision-making process.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Collect real-time OHLCV data from cryptocurrency exchanges (ccxt), real-time news via GNews API, and Google Trends data (pytrends).
- **Feature Engineering**: Compute technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) using the `ta` library, sentiment analysis via VADER, and NLP-based topic modeling from news feeds.
- **Machine Learning (ML) Modeling**: Train XGBoost and LightGBM models for Buy/Sell/Hold signal predictions.
- **Deep Learning (DL) Modeling**: Use LSTM models for time series forecasting to predict future market behavior.
- **Explainability**: Interpret model decisions using SHAP for transparency.
- **Backtesting**: Validate strategies through backtesting with the `bt` library to simulate trading and measure performance.
- **Real-Time AI Intelligence**: Generate human-like summaries from crypto news using OpenAI GPT, and track trends via Google Trends.
- **Signal Delivery**: Send daily crypto signals via Telegram bot and generate PDF reports.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard with real-time sentiment, trend analysis, and Buy/Sell signals using Plotly and Tableau.
- **Scheduling**: Automate the entire flow (data collection, model retraining, alerts) using APScheduler.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the Flask-based web app for interactive visualization and monitoring via Vercel.

## Usage

### Signal Generation
Once the system is running, it will automatically pull real-time market data and news, process the data, and generate actionable trading signals based on the trained machine learning models. These signals will indicate whether to buy, sell, or hold a given cryptocurrency. The models are trained on technical indicators, sentiment data, and news summaries, providing highly informed and reliable trading recommendations.

### Dashboard
The system provides an interactive dashboard built with Flask and Plotly. Through the dashboard, you can visualize:

- **Real-time Market Data**: View the latest OHLCV data for the selected cryptocurrencies.
- **Trading Signals**: Display the Buy/Sell/Hold signals generated by the AI models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: See how the public sentiment for cryptocurrencies is trending, based on news sentiment and social media data.
- **Feature Importance**: Explore the factors influencing the model's predictions with SHAP explainability.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: View the results of backtesting strategies, including Sharpe ratio, win rate, and drawdowns.

The dashboard serves as a one-stop interface to monitor the system's performance and track the signals in real-time.

### Reports & Alerts
The system will send **daily trading signals** via Telegram and generate **PDF reports** with detailed insights, including the generated signals, market data, and any important events or news summaries for the day. The Telegram bot will push these alerts directly to your phone, ensuring you never miss critical trading signals.

### Automated Scheduling
The entire process, from data collection to model retraining and alert delivery, is automated. This is achieved using APScheduler, which runs in the background to:

- Pull real-time market data from exchanges and news APIs.
- Retrain models on fresh data to ensure they remain up to date.
- Send daily trading signals and PDF reports via Telegram bot.
- Handle backtesting and performance evaluation on a scheduled basis.

This system ensures that you can operate with minimal manual intervention, with everything running on a well-defined schedule to optimize trading strategies.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Cryptocurrency Coverage**: The current system is configured for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Future plans include expanding the system to support the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
- **Advanced Models**: Future versions of the system may incorporate reinforcement learning-based strategies or other advanced AI techniques to further enhance the decision-making process.
- **Improved Sentiment Analysis**: Using advanced NLP techniques, the sentiment analysis module can be upgraded to capture more nuanced market sentiment and increase the accuracy of trading signals.
- **Dynamic Cryptocurrency Selection**: The system can be upgraded to dynamically select cryptocurrencies based on market volatility or interest, making it adaptable to changing market conditions.
